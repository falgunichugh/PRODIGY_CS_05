# PRODIGY_CS_05
This Python script leverages the Scapy library to capture and analyze network packets, offering insights into network traffic by logging source and destination IP addresses. 

Users are prompted to consent before initiating packet sniffing, ensuring ethical use. The tool is designed for educational purposes, providing a hands-on approach to understanding network protocols and traffic analysis. 

To use, install Scapy (pip install scapy), run the script (python network_packet_analyzer.py), agree to packet sniffing when prompted, and terminate by pressing 'Ctrl + C' in the terminal.
